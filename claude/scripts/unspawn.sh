# unspawn.sh — tear down a Claude tab opened via spawn/ccw: close its cmux workspace
# and (by default) remove the worktree + branch it ran in. The inverse of spawn.sh.
# Address it by branch/tab name.
#
# When no live tab is found we still treat the argument as a branch label, so a
# worktree left behind after Claude exited can still be cleaned up.
#
# Safety: pinned tabs are left alone, worktree removal refuses when the worktree has
# uncommitted/untracked files, and the branch is deleted only when fully merged. Re-run
# with --force to override all three. --keep-worktree closes only the tab and leaves the
# worktree in place.
#
# Usage:
#   unspawn.sh <branch> [--keep-worktree] [--force]
