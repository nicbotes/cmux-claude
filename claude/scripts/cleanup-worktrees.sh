# cleanup-worktrees.sh — remove git worktrees whose work appears to be done:
#   - Backing branch's PR is MERGED or CLOSED on GitHub, OR
#   - Backing branch is fully merged into origin/master (or origin/main)
#
# The teardown counterpart to new-worktree.sh; both operate on the worktrees under
# <main-repo>/.claude/worktrees/. Run from the main repo (not from inside a worktree).
#
# Safe-by-default:
#   - Never touches the main worktree
#   - Skips removal if the worktree has uncommitted changes — reports it instead
#   - Skips removal if both PR-state and merged-into-base checks are inconclusive
#   - If gh is unavailable, falls back to merged-into-base check only
